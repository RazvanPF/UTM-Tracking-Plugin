## About the Plugin  

UTM Tracker is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to track UTM parameters, store them in sessions, and append them dynamically to internal and external links. It ensures that marketing and tracking data remains intact across user navigation, even when moving between pages or subdomains.

In addition to UTM tracking, this plugin provides advanced features such as **email replacement based on UTM presence**, **host-based UTM propagation**, and **cache bypass** to improve compatibility with caching plugins.

With an intuitive settings panel, users can configure UTM rules, debug logs, email replacements, and cache settings effortlessly.

## Use Cases  

### ðŸ”¹ Track UTM Parameters Without Losing Data  
If a visitor lands on your site with UTM parameters (e.g., from an ad campaign), the plugin will **store those UTM values in a session**. Even if they navigate through multiple pages, the UTM parameters will **persist** in the background.

### ðŸ”¹ Ensure UTM Parameters Stay on Internal & External Links  
If a visitor clicks an internal or allowed external link, the plugin **automatically appends the stored UTM parameters**, ensuring attribution continuity.

### ðŸ”¹ Email Replacement Based on UTM Presence  
If a user lands on your site with UTM parameters but **doesn't fill out a form**, instead deciding to email you manually, they will see a **different email address** (set in the plugin settings).  
- If you receive an email at the **alternate UTM-based email**, you **know the user came from a tracked campaign**.  
- If they use your **regular email**, it indicates they came from an **organic or untracked source**.

### ðŸ”¹ Hide UTM Parameters for a Cleaner URL  
This feature **removes UTM parameters from the browser URL** while keeping them in session storage, providing a **cleaner** experience for users while maintaining tracking integrity.

### ðŸ”¹ Bypass Cache for Caching Plugins  
If a caching plugin **interferes with UTM tracking**, enabling the **Bypass Cache** option ensures that each visitor receives fresh UTM data without being affected by previously cached pages.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes on Caching Plugins  

If your WordPress site uses a caching plugin (e.g., **WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, or LiteSpeed Cache**), UTM parameters may get cached incorrectly.  

### âœ… How to Ensure UTM Tracking Works with Caching Plugins  

1. **Enable "Bypass Cache" in the UTM Tracker settings** *(recommended)*.  
2. **Exclude UTM-related pages from caching** *(if issues persist)*.  
3. **Manually clear the cache after saving changes in UTM Tracker**.  

For best results, consult your caching pluginâ€™s documentation on excluding query parameters from caching.
